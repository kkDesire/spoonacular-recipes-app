Microwave the butter for 30 second intervals until the butter has completely melted.\nThen whisk in some granulated sugar.\nNext, whisk in two eggs.\nNow you're going to mix together some buttermilk and baking soda and pour this into the mixture. Stir until well combined.\nLastly, pour in cornmeal, flour, salt, shredded cheddar cheese, and canned diced jalapenos! Make sure you mix this until the mixture is *just* combined. Don't over mix, or you'll end up with tough bread!\nPreheat your oven to 375 degrees F and prepare a pan with cooking spray. I used a mini loaf pan very similar to this mini loaf pan, but an 8 x 8 pan would work, too! Although, the cooking time may vary. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and top the batter with thinly sliced fresh jalapenos.\nBake for about 25 to 35 minutes - again, the cooking time may vary depending on the size of your pan.\nRemove from the oven, and let the loaves cool in the pan for a few minutes.\nRemove from the pan and let set on a cooling rack until you're ready to serve!"},{"id":642648,"title":"Favorite Moist Chocolate Cake","image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/642648-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","servings":12,"readyInMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodista.com/recipe/22CXSPRX/favorite-moist-chocolate-cake","sourceName":"Foodista","summary":"Favorite Moist Chocolate Cake might be just the dessert you are searching for.

Using a large spoon, discard any excess fat/grease. Add the onions, celery, and garlic mixture back to skillet and stir well. Add the worcestershire sauce, thyme and cook for an additional minute. Add frozen vegetables and gravy and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\nCover a large casserole dish with cooking spray. Pour the ground beef/vegetable mixture into the dish and spread evenly. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top and carefully spread to create an even layer. Sprinkle parmesan cheese all over the top and place the dish in the preheated oven. Bake for 25-30 minutes. Turn the oven broiler on and brown the top of the Shepherds Pie until it turns an even golden brown color.\nRemove from the oven and allow to set for 5-10 minutes before serving.

Take off the heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes to gently finish cooking the fish. Lift the fish out of the milk with a slotted spoon and put on a plate to cool.\nMeanwhile, cook the potatoes in the salted water for 10 minutes or until tender, but not broken up. Drain the potatoes and leave them for a minute or two.\nTip them back into the hot pan on the lowest heat and let them dry out for 1 minute, mashing them with a fork and stirring so they don't stick. You should have a light, dry fluffy mash. Take off the heat and beat in 1 tablespoon of the sauce, then the lemon zest, parsley, pepper and chives. Set aside.\nDrain off liquid from the fish, then flake it into big chunks into the pan of potatoes. Using your hands, gently lift the fish and potatoes together so they just mix. Do it with only a couple of turns, or the fish will break up too much. Put to aside and cool.\nBeat the egg on a large plate and lightly flour a board. Spread the breadcrumbs on another plate. On the floured board, and with floured hands, carefully shape into 4-6 cakes, about 2.5 cm thick. One by one, put each cake in the egg, and brush over the top and sides so it is completely coated. Transfer each cake to the plate with bread crumbs, pat the crumbs on the sides and tops so they are lightly covered. Transfer to a plate, cover and chill for 30 minutes (or up to a day ahead).\nFry the fish cakes in hot oil over a medium heat for about 5 minutes on each side or until crisp and golden.
