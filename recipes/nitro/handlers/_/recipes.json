Chop the onion into square pieces. Chop green onions and separate the white and green parts. Zest the orange.\nIn a saut pan, add vegetable oil and turn to high heat. Add in the chicken and saut for 1 minute. Toss the chicken and saut for another minute or until caramelized. Transfer the chicken to a dish.\nContinue to use high heat. Add the chopped onion to the pan and saut until soft. Add the chicken back to the pan, with the white parts of the green onion and orange zest. Cook for about 30 seconds.

Cut the soft white bread into small cubes of 1cm all round.</li><li>Add the chopped bread to the beef mixture.</li><li>Add 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley. Use Italian flat parsley where possible. I couldnt find any, so I used English parsley.</li><li>Add 1 large egg.</li><li>Add salt and pepper to taste. I used approximately 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of black pepper.</li><li>Mix well to combine.</li><li>Shape the meat mixture into balls that are slightly bigger than the size of a golf ball size. Roll the meat tightly to form meatballs.</li><li>Add 3/4 cup of olive oil to frying pan. The layer of oil should be approximately 3/4cm in the pan.</li><li>Put the pan on medium-high heat and add the meatballs to the oil. Gently roll them around in the oil to brown all surfaces and ensure even cooking.</li><li>When the meatballs are a deep golden brown, remove them from the frying pan and set aside.</li><li>The tomatoes-onion mixture should have reduced to a sauce consistency now. You can use a hand blender to puree the mixture.
