Once the bisque is ladled into bowls, sprinkle the top with the crispy bacon."},{"id":991625,"title":"Nutella Buttercream Cupcakes with Hidden Cadbury Egg","image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/991625-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","servings":6,"readyInMinutes":35,"sourceUrl":"https://www.pinkwhen.com/nutella-buttercream-cupcakes-with-hidden-cadbury-egg/","summary":"The recipe Nutella Buttercream Cupcakes with Hidden Cadbury Egg can be made <b>in about 35 minutes</b>.

Cut in half, then each half in halves, etc ... (This will be very, VERY messy; the dough is slippery, apples will fall out, sugar syrup will ooze... it's not pretty. Don't worry, and don't stress about making all the pieces the same size).</li><li>Lay the dough chunks into the pan (Crowd them so that they all fit in a single tight layer - barely. Lots of apple chunks will fall out during this process; just tuck them in among the dough pieces, or simply spread them on top.).</li><li>Cover the challah gently with lightly greased plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise for about 1- 1 1/2 hours, until it's a generous 2inches high (It should just crest the rim of a 9inch round cake pan). Twenty minutes before the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 325 F.</li><li>Place the bread in the lower third of the oven.

and stir constantly until the mixture starts to thicken.\nAdd the beans, chopped chicken, chili powder, coriander and cumin.\nIncrease the heat to medium and, stirring frequently, simmer, uncovered for approximately 15-20 minutes or until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.\nReduce the heat to low and add the fresh coriander, single cream and soured cream.\nStir well until the single and soured creams are completely incorporated into the chili.\nAdd pepper to taste.\nServe immediately.\nGarnish with chopped avocado, spring onion, fresh coriander or grated cheese.\nLike most soups, this chili is great refrigerated and served the next day but if you intend on freezing it, leave out the whipping cream and soured cream (they separate when frozen) and add them just before serving.\nIf youd like to spice things up a bit, add  -  teaspoon cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes for a slightly hot flavor."},{"id":640959,"title":"Crunchy Prawn Skewers With Lemony

Add mustard seeds and saute for 30 seconds-till you hear popping noises. Add curry leaves- BE CAREFUL, they pop hot oil! Add onions and peppers- sweat for about 30 seconds. Add chopped garlic, chilies and turmeric. Saute for about 5-7 minutes, until the onions and peppers are soft. Add peas and carrots mixture, cumin powder and salt. Saute for about 7-10 minutes- you want all the veggies to be soft and cooked through.\nMeanwhile in a small bowl, add the cubed tofu, a pinch of turmeric, cumin powder, coarse black pepper and some cayenne pepper (totally optional!). Mix and set aside to marinate for a bit.\nOnce the veggies are cooked, add the tofu- saute until slightly brown and soft enough that it crumbles. Add juice form half a lemon and half of the chopped cilantro. Mix and add the diced boiled potato, and toss until everything is coated, soft and taste for salt/spices. Using a masher, mash the mixture until mushy and until the veggies are small. Set aside to cool. Once cooled, add a bit of the breadcrumbs and mix with your hands. Start forming into thick patties (mixture should make 4). If its still giving you a hard time, add more breadcrumbs. Make 4 patties, place on a plate and wrap with plastic wrap until ready to use.\nIn a small skillet sprayed with PAM over medium-high heat, add one patty at a time. Cook for about 2 minutes on each side- until browned and crispy.At the same time, saute the thick slices of onion, until charred and slightly soft. Spread a generous amount of the chutney spread on each side on the bread, place burger, onions tomato and cilantro leaves. Serve with a slice of lemon and reduced-fat chips on the side."},{"id":642091,"title":"Easy Shepherd's Pie (Beef And/or Lamb Combo)","image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/642091-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","servings":6,"readyInMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodista.com/recipe/MZ6R763H/easy-shepherds-pie-beef-andor-lamb-combo","summary":"Easy Shepherd's Pie (Beef And/or Lamb Combo) takes roughly <b>45 minutes</b> from beginning to end.
